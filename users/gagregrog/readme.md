# Gagregrog Userspace

Check out each markdown file in this userspace to see what features are available and always-active.

## How to Use

In your keymap add `#include "gagregrog.h"` in order to use custom keycodes etc.

If you want to use these features in a keymap that is named something other than `gagregrog` then you must add `USER_NAME := gagregrog` to the `rules.mk` inside your keymap folder.

## Features

### Tap Dances

Check out [tap_dance.md](./tap_dance/tap_dance.md) to see all of the great features that are automatically exposed when you enable tap dances.

### Mouse Turbo Click

Add `MOUSE_TURBO_CLICK = yes` to your `rules.mk` to enable turbo click! Use `MS_TURBO` keycode to rapid fire mouse click. This will automatically enable `MOUSEKEY_ENABLE` and `DEFERRED_EXEC_ENABLE` features. This feature was taken from https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/mouse-turbo-click/index.html.

### TODO: Update this Readme :-)

The list of features here is not up to date, so look at all of the individual directories within `users/gagregrog` to get a sense of what is available, and in particular take a look at `[rules.mk](./rules.mk)` and `[gagregrog.c](./gagregrog.c)` to see what has been implemented by default, and what can be enabled.
